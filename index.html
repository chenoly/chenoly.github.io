					<h4>Physically Anti-Copying Semi-Robust Mixed-bit Watermarking</h4>
          <p>Counterfeiting commodities is a pervasive problem that has detrimental impacts on consumers, and businesses. 
            However, the high cost of anti-counterfeiting labels made of unique materials necessitates the development of physically anti-copying (PAC) low-cost solutions. 
            Although existing PAC schemes have achieved some success, they can not balance information embedding and transparency. 
            While watermarking is a widely used information-hiding technology, current watermarking schemes have yet to effectively resist illegal copying (IC) attacks. 
            To address these challenges, we proposed a physical anti-copying watermarking (PACW) solution called mixed-bit random watermarking for QR codes. 
            The method employs a sampling-based watermarking scheme that leverages mutually orthogonal templates and a mixed-bit random embedding strategy to randomly sample from these templates, 
            resulting in a watermarked QR code image that retains both 0 and 1 bits while embedding strength is controlled by Bernoulli distribution. 
            The watermarking algorithm applies the maximum entropy principle to achieve PAC and presents a high-density random graph in QR codes, 
            and experiments demonstrate its effectiveness, including simulations of two attack protocols. This PACW solution effectively resists IC attacks to a certain extent.</p>/>

					<h4>MSG: Mixed-bit Sampling Graph for Anti-Counterfeiting</h4>
          <p>Nowadays, copy detection pattern (CDP) is gaining market recognition as an anti-counterfeiting solution with its low cost and efficient anti-counterfeiting effect. 
            In fact, CDP itself does not carry any information, but is only a high-density random pattern; 
            therefore, the way CDP achieves anti-counterfeiting is usually attached to the carrier as an accessory (\emph{e.g.,} QR code). 
            For this reason, this paper proposed a new anti-counterfeiting scheme, a mixed-bit sampling graph (MSG). 
            The main difference between MSG and CDP is that, functionally, MSG can carry the watermark and provide an additional communication channel. 
            More importantly, visually, there is not much difference from CDP, and both utilize the maximum entropy principle. 
            Specifically, MSG is composed of multiple mixed sampling blocks (MSBs), each containing one watermark bit, obtained by sampling the pixels of two orthogonal templates. 
            We model the sampling process as a constrained optimization problem, where the objective function is to control the proportion of black and white pixels in the MSB, 
            and the constraint is to ensure the successful embedding of the watermarked bit. We sample the templates by treating their sampling process as a Markov chain, 
            which is sampled using the Metropolis-Hasting sampling. The MSB is then obtained by controlling the conditions that the difference of the sampling strength of two orthogonal templates need to be satisfied, and finally, 
            multiple MSBs are combined to obtain the MSG. Experiments show that MSG can indeed be used as an anti-counterfeiting solution.</p>/>

					<h4>Physically Robust Reversible Watermarking</h4>
          <p>In this work, we for the first time propose a novel invisible digital image watermarking framework which dubbed as Physical Robust Reversible Watermarking (PRRW). 
            The proposed PRRW enjoys two merits. First, it allows for complete extraction of the watermark and perfect reconstruction of the cover image when the watermarked image shared through digital lossless channel. 
            Second, the PRRW is resilient to distortions caused by the physically screen-to-camera communication channel. 
            Specifically, PRRW is based on a template-based robust watermarking scheme and we further arm it with reversibility. 
            For watermark embedding, we first identify a sub-image of the cover image that can accommodate the maximum embeddable strength, and then embed the watermark into it. 
            For watermark extraction, we introduce a watermark detection network that could accurately locate the marked sub-image and extract the watermark, 
            without any assistance from any landmarks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and practical usage of the proposed PRRW framework.</p>/>
